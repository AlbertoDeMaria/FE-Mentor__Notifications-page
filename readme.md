## Front-End Mentor Challenge
### Junior Level (Html + CSS + Responsive design + JavaScript)

Hello everyone, thank you for checking out my work. This is a challenge I wanted to take on to work on and improve my skills as a Frontend developer. I found the challenge on the famous Front-end Mentor website (https://www.frontendmentor.io/) and decided to give it a try.

This is the second level of difficulty offered by Front-End Mentor, and in these projects, JavaScript comes into play. You have to work with dynamic elements and sometimes APIs. To slightly increase the difficulty, I chose to use the SCSS preprocessor to practice optimized coding based on variables.

You can find the original design provided by Front-end Mentor and my result.

!! I want to specify that the design did not provide any information regarding text sizes, padding, or other project details, so I made my best judgment. !!
